# OpenAI proxy

When you run into issues connecting to OpenAI, due to VPN restrictions or so, use this simple proxy. 
- run `yarn` to install packages
- run `yarn start` to start

I use this in combination with [MindMac](https://mindmac.app/). Note that you need a ChatGPT API key, preferably with GPT4 model rights.
